# keylogger
WIP, re-learning python with a scalable project


It's been a minute since I really touched Python (Back in 2019 in fact, last time using it in my senior year of high school); so the plan is to use a couple resources to form a rough skeleton of what a keylogger looks like, how it should behave, etc etc. After the skeleton is formed, the next step is to build upon it with (what I believe) to be nice addons to make a keylogger more... interesting.
